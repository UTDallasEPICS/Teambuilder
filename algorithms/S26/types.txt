This file holds all data structures with information about
UTD majors and configuration presets

Student structure (I know a schema exists somewhere else, this
is for the algorithm and so I can customize without messing with
anything else)

Student:
    id: unique identifier (string)
    name: full name (string)
    major: one of UTD ECS majors or "Other"
        Biomedical Engineering
        Computer Engineering
        Computer Science
        Data Science
        Electrical Engineering
        Mechanical Engineering

    seniority:
        Freshman
        Sophomore
        Junior
        Senior
    preferences: array of selected project names, with rank
    skills: array of top selected skills, ideally an array of these would be nice
    gender: yes, it's limited, Andrea wanted it that way so it's like this for now
        Male
        Female
    availableDay:
        Wednesday
        Thursday
    returningToProject: optional project name, only 3200
  
    FUTURE FEATURE: 
        Personal statements
        projectFitScores: manually map statement to..?

Project:
    id: unique identifier (string)
    name: project name (string)
    projectType:
        Software
        Hardware
        Both
    meetingDay:
        Wednesday Thursday
    requiredSkills: array of skill strings
    majorRequirements: how many students of each major wanted
        Example: {"Computer Science": 2, "Electrical Engineering": 1}
        Means: need at least 2 CS students and 1 EE student

Sort_methods:
    teamSizeMin: minimum team size (default: 4)
    teamSizeIdeal: ideal max (default: 6)
    teamSizeSoftMax: acceptable with light penalty (default: 7)
    teamSizeHardMax: absolute maximum (default: 10)
  
    optimizationMode: 
        student-first
        project-first
        balanced
        fair-distribution
  
    weights: scoring weights object
        upper3200FirstChoice: how much to value 3200 first choice
        upper3200SecondChoice: 3200 second choice
        upper3200ThirdChoice: 3200 third choice
        lower2200FirstChoice: 2200 first choice
        lower2200SecondChoice: 2200 second choice
        lower2200ThirdChoice: 2200 third choice
        lower2200FourthToSixth: penalty for 2200 getting 4th-6th
        returningStudentBonus: bonus for returning to same project
        skillMatchBonus: bonus per matching skill
        majorMatchBonus: bonus for matching major type
        genderIsolationPenalty: penalty for 1 person of a gender
        teamSizeLightPenalty: penalty per student when team = 7
        teamSizeHeavyPenalty: penalty per student when team >= 8
        projectActivationBonus: reward for keeping project active

Preset_configurations:
    studentFirst: maximize student preference satisfaction
    projectFirst: prioritize project skill/major needs
    balanced: compromise between student and project
    fairDistribution: minimize variance in outcomes

Results: to be displayed
    success: boolean
    teamAssignments: map of {projectName -> array of Student objects}
    deactivatedProjects: array of project names with 0 students
    statistics: object with metrics
        totalStudents assigned
        preference satisfaction breakdown
        average team size
        constraint violations (if any)
    score: optimization score achieved
    solveTime: time taken in seconds
    status:
